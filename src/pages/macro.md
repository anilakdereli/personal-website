# [[EC 214 - Macroeconomics]]
## National Income
National income means **the value of goods and services produced by a country during a financial year**. Thus, it is the net result of all economic activities of any country during a period of one year and is valued in terms of money.

### The Factors of Production
Factors of production are the inputs used to produce goods and services. The two most important factors of production are:
- Capital
- Labor

Capital: the set of tools that workers use --> K
Labor: the time people spend working. --> L

>[!INFO] The Production Function
>Y = (K, L)

### Factor Prices
The distribution of national income is determined by factor prices. Factor prices are the amounts paid to the factor of production.

### The Profit
The goal of the firm is to maximize profit. ==Profit equals revenue minus costs.==

>[!info] Profit
> - Profit = Revenue - Labor Costs - Capital Costs
> - Profit = PY - WL - RK
> - Profit = PF(K, L) - WL - RK
>P, price - W, wage - R, rent

Too see how profit depends on the factors of production, we use the production functions: **Y = F(K, L)** to substitute for Y to obtain

### The Marginal Product of Labor
MPL, the more labor the firm employs, the more output it produces. The marginal product of labor (MPL) is ==the extra amount of output the firm gets from one extra unit of labor, holding the amount of capital fixed.==

>[!info] The Marginal Product of Labor
>MPL = F(K, L + 1) - F(K, L)

**Diminishing Marginal Product**: holding the amount of capital fixed, to marginal product of labor decreases as the amount of labor increases.

![[PNG image 3.png]]

The change in profit from hiring an additional unit of labor is
delta Profit = delta Revenue - delta Cost
delta Profit = (P x MPL) - W

==MPL = W / P (The real wage)==

### The Marginal of Capital & Capital Demand
The marginal product of capital (MPK) is the amount of extra output the firm gets from an extra unit of capital, holding the amount of labor constant: 

>[!info] Marginal Product of Capital
>MPK = F(K + 1, L) - F(K, L)

![[PNG image 4.png]]

delta Profit = delta Revenue - delta Cost
delta Profit = (P x MPK) - R

To maximize profit, the firm continues to rent more capital until the MPK falls to equal the real rental price:

>[!info] The Real Rental Price of Capital
> MPK = R / P

To sum up, the competitive, profit-maximizing firm follows a simple rule about how much labor to gire and how much capital to rent. ==The firm demands each factor of production until that factor's marginal product falls to equal its real factor price.==

### The Division of National Income
If all firms in the economy are competitive and profit maximizing, then each factor of production is paid its marginal contribution to the production process.

Kisaca biz bu isi ogrendik anasini sikene kadar maximize edecegiz. Oyleyse gelin bunu formule dokelim.

>[!info] The Real Economic Profit
Economic Profit = Y - (MPL x L) - (MPK x K)

If we want to examine the distribution of national income, we rearrange the terms as follows: ==Y = (MPL x L) + (MPK x K) + Economic Profit==

**==Euler's theorem:==** If the production function has the property of constant return to scale, as is often thought to be the case, then economics profit must be zero.

If the production function has constant returns to scale, then: ==F(K, L) = (MPK x K) + (MPL x L)

>[!info] Accounting Profit
>Accounting Profit = Economic Profit + (MPK x K)

**Economic Profit vs Accounting Profit**
Economic profit refers to total revenue from sales minus opportunity costs from all inputs. Accounting profit, on the other hand, represents the total earnings of a company, which includes explicit costs.

### The Cobb Douglas Production Function
Ekonomiden kim ne kadar payini aliyor. Kim kimi ne kadar kopartiyor 

- ==Capital Income = MPK x K = alfa Y==
- ==Labor Income = MPL x L = (1 - alfa) Y==

Where alfa is a constant between zero and one that measures capital's share of income. That is, alfa determines what share of income goes to capital and what share goes to labor. Cobb showed that the function with this property is: (MathLatex lazim)

>[!info]
>Cobb-Douglas Production Function
>MathLatex ogren 

The marginal products for the Cobb-Douglas production function also can be written as:
- MPL = (1 - alfa) Y/L
- MPK = alfa Y/K

"Y/L" is called average labor productivity, "Y/K" is called average capital productivity

==If the production function is Cobb-Douglas, then the marginal productivity of a factor is proportional to its average productivity.==

The neoclassical theory of distribution tells us that the real wage "W/P" equals the marginal product of labor. The Cobb-Douglas production function tells us that the marginal product of labor is proportional to average labor productivity "Y/L"

## Gross Domestic Products (GDP)
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period. There are four components of GDP:
- Consumption (C)
- Investment (I)
- Government Purchases (G)
- Net Exports (NX)

>[!info] Gross Domestic Products (GDP)
>Y = C + I + G
>(In a closed economy)

### Consumption
We define income after the payment of all taxes, Y - T, to be **disposable income.** Households divide their disposable income between consumption and saving.

A higher level of disposable income leads to greater consumption. Thus, ==C = C(Y - T)==
This equation states that consumption is a function of disposable income. The relationship between consumption and disposable income is called the consumption function. 

![[PNG image 5.png]]

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the amount by which consumption changes when disposable income increases by one dollar. 

### Investment
The quantity of investment goods demanded depends on the interest rate, which measurer the cost of the funds used to finance investment.

When studying the role of interest rates in the economy, economists distinguish between the nominal interest rate and the real interest rate.
- Nominal Interest Rate: the interest rate as usually reported. It's the rate of interest that investors pay to borrow money.
- Real Interest Rate: the nominal interest rate corrected for the effects of inflation.

We can summarize this discussion with an equation relating investment "I" to the real interest rate "r": ==I = I(r)==

![[PNG image 6.png]]

### Government
Government purchases are the third component of the demand for goods and services. The other type is transfer payments to households, such as welfare for the poor and social security payment for the elderly.

- Balanced budget: G = T
- Budget Deficit: G > T
- Budget Surplus: G < T

### Equilibrium in the Market for Goods & Services

![[PNG image 7.png]]

This equation states that the supply of output equals its demanded, which is the sum of consumption, investment and government purchases.

Interest rate "r" has a key role. If the interest rate is too high, then investment is too low and the demand for output falls short of the supply. If the interest is too low, then investment is too high and the demand exceeds the supply.

### Equilibrium in the Financial Markets
We rewrite the national income accounts identity to understand interest's role in financial markets: ==Y - C - G = I==

The term "Y - C - G" is the output that remains after the demands of consumers and the government have been satisfied; it is called **national saving** or simply **saving(S)**. 

To understand this identity more fully, we can split national saving into two parts:

- Representing the saving of the private sector
- Representing the saving of the government

>[!info] National Saving / Saving (S)
>S = (Y - T - C) + (T - G) = I

- The term (Y - T - C) is disposable income minus consumption, which is **private saving.**
- The term (T - G) is government revenue minus government spending, which is **public saving.**

National saving is the sum of private and public saving.

### The Effect of Fiscal Policy

![[PNG image 10.png]]

### Changes in Investment Demand
One reason investment demand might increase is technological innovation. Investment demand may also change because the government encourages or discourages investment thorough the tax laws.

## The Monetary System
There are two two arms of macroeconomics policy.

1. Monetary
2. Fiscal

Fiscal Policy: encompasses the government's decisions about spending and taxation.
Monetary Policy: It refers to decision about the nation's system of coin, currency and banking.

### What Is Money?
Money is the stock of assets that cna be readily used to make transactions. Money has three purposes:

- Store of value
- Unit of account
- Medium of exchange

The types of money: 

- Fiat Money
- Commodity Money

The quantity of money available in an economy is called the **money supply.** The government's control over the money supply is called **monetary policy.**

### The Role of Banks in the Monetary System

>[!info] Money Supply
>Money Supply  = Currency + Demand Deposits
>M = C + D

#### 100 Percent Reverse Banking
The deposits that bank have received but have not lent out are called reserves.

![[PNG image 14.png]]

==If banks hold 100 percent of deposits in reserve, the banking system does not affect the supply of money.==

#### Fractional Reverse Banking
Fractional reverse banking represents that making loan which banks keep only a fraction of their deposits in reverse.

In a system of fractional reserve banking, banks create money and banks can change supply of money.

>[!example] 
>![[PNG image 15.png]]
>Money Supply: $ 1000 (Deposits) + $ 800 (Loan) = $ 1800
>Money Demand: $ 1000 (Deposits)
>The bank increased the money supply with letting the loan.
>
>The creation of money does not stop with First Bank. If the borrower deposits the $ 800 in another bank, the process of money creation continues.
>![[PNG image 16.png]]
>Money Supply: $800 + $ 640 = $ 1440
>Money Demand: $800
>
>The Total of Money Supply: $ 3240
>The Total of Money Demand: $ 1000

This process of money creation can continue forever, but it does not create an infinite amount of money. Letting `rr` denote the reserve deposit ratio, the amount of money that the original $ 1000 create is: 

![[PNG image 17.png]]

==The banking system's ability to create money is the primary difference between banks and other financial institutions.==

The process of transferring fund from savers to borrowers is called **financial intermediation.**

==The banking system increases the economy's liquidity, not its wealth.==

#### Bank Capital, Leverage & Capital Requirements
The bank owners must start with some financial resources to get the business going. Those resources are called **bank capital** or, equivalently, the equity of bank's owners.

![[PNG image 18.png]]

Leverage is the use of borrowed money to supplement existing funds for purposes of investment. ==The leverage ratio is the ratio of the bank's total assets to bank capital.==

The goals of such a **capital requirement** is to ensure that banks will be able to pay off their depositors.

### Model of the Money Supply
We begin by presenting a model of the money supply under fractional-reserve banking.The model has three exogenous variables:

- The **monetary base**: `B` is the total number of dollars held by the public as currency `C` and by the banks as reserves `R`. It is directly controlled by the Federal Reserve.
- The **reserve deposit ratio**: `rr` is the fraction of deposits that banks hold in reserve. It is determined by the business policies of banks and the laws regulating banks.
- The **currency deposit ratio**: `cr` is the amount of currency `C` people hold as a fraction of their holdings of demand deposits `D`. It reflects the preferences of households about the form of money they wish to hold.

### The Instruments of Monetary Policy
The instruments can be classified into two broad groups: those that influence the monetary base and those that influence the reserve deposit ratio and thereby the money multiplier.

### Inflation
Overall increasing in prices is called **inflation.**

**Hyperinflation:** Extraordinarily high inflation.
**Inflation Tax:** Governments raised by priting money. 

#### The Quantity Theory of Money
The insight that people hold money to buy goods and services.

>[!formula] Quantity Equation
>Money x Velocity = Price x Transactionsi
>
>M x V = P x T

#### The Money Demand Function and the Quantity Equation
When we analyze how money affeccts the economy, it is often useful express the quantity of money in terms of the quantity of goods and services it can buy.

This amount, **M/P**, is called **real money balances.** ==Real money balances measure the purchasin power of the stock of money.==

A **money demand function** is an equation that shows the determinants of the quantity of real money balances people wish to hold. 

>[!formula] Money Demand Function
>MV = PY

#### Seigniorage
The revenue raised by the printing ofm oney is called seignorage.

The increase in the money supply, in turn, causes inflation. Pringting money to raise revenue is like imposing an inflation tax.

Printing money increase the output (Y) in short term, but price (P) will catch up in the long term.

### Inflation and Interest Rates
#### Real & Nominal Insterest Rates
The interest rate that the bnak pays is called the **nominal interest rate(i)**. The increase in your purchasing power is called the **real interest rate (r).**
	The rate of inflation = π 

>[!formula] Real Interest Rate
>Real Interest = Nominal Insterest Rate - Rate of Inflation
>
>r = i - π

#### The Fisher Effect
xxx

#### Ex Ante & Ex Post
The real interest reate the borrower and lender expect when the loan is made, called the **ex ante real interest rate**. The real interest rate that is actually realized, called the **ex post real interest rate.**

Expectation of future inflation = Eπ = Ex ante Real Interest Rate

### The Nominal Interest Rate & The Demand for Money
#### The Cost of Holding Money
The nominal interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding money.

Another way to see that the cost of holding money equals the nominal interest rate is by comparing the real returns on alternative assets.
